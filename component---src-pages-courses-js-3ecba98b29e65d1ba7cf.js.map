We also understand that our students themselves are multidisciplinary, and are often involved in many things outside of their studies. We wanted to showcase our students in a way that hasn’t been done before; thus, the Slash Student project was born! Slash Student gives us a place to highlight all the things that make students unique and allow them to excel in many ways. Check out our Slash Student album here, and the article written about the project by Darrien Rose on our Medium page. If you or someone you know would like to be highlighted as a Slash Student, please email us and let us know.\n    </p>,\n    \"links\": [],\n    \"image\": \"slash_student\"\n  }, \n  {\n    \"tabTitle\": \"ENG 198\",\n    \"textTitle\": \"ENG 198\",\n    \"paragraphs\": <><p className=\"serif\">One of our main initiatives at SCD is to broaden the definition of innovation to include innovations within the social sphere. There are so many inspiring individuals and groups affiliated with our university that are creating change with their innovative ideas. We thought highlighting some of these people would be a great way to inspire others to dive deeper into social innovation, so we created the Social Innovation Spotlight. We share a different individual or group’s story each week on our social media pages as well as on our <a href=\"/stories\">Social Innovation Spotlight page</a>. Make sure you check it out!</p><p className=\"serif\">If you or someone you know is working on a socially innovative project that you think should be spotlighted, please email us.</p></>,\n    \"image\": \"hq_coming_soon\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"tabTitle\": \"ECE 445\",\n    \"textTitle\": \"ECE 445\",\n    \"paragraphs\": <p className=\"serif\">AMA= \"Ask Me Anything,\" and that's what Rachel, Director of the Siebel Center for Design, wants you to do!
