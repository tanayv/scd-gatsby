            We have been hosting many different “Pop-Up Workshops,” which are opportunities for us to teach the design thinking process to students unable to enroll in one of our courses. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We’ve had Pop-Ups focused on farmer’s markets, cat behaviors, student eating habits, storytelling, and more! These Pop-Ups allow students to get a bite-sized version of the Design Thinking process in a workshop-style event.
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We’ll be having many more Pop-Up Workshops in the future, so make sure you check out our upcoming events on our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SCDillinois">Facebook page!</a>

            We had our first Loveapalooza February of 2019 in the Courtyard Cafe. It was a night of stories, performances, and activities all relating to themes surrounding Valentine’s Day. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We partnered with professors and students all across the university that told stories about how their fields relate to love and friendship, and we also worked with the CU Community Fab Lab, Illinois MakerLab, McKinley Stress Management Peers, McKinley Sexual Health Peers, Flor Poetry, Illini Swing Society, and the Creative Writing Club.  
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We also had an amazing chocolate fountain and heart balloons littering the Courtyard Cafe!

                As a double alum of the University of Illinois, Rachel Switzky, Director of SCD, wanted to be reminded of what it was like being a freshman on campus. 
                </p>
                <p className="serif">
                In order to gain empathy for our first-year students, Rachel decided to build a dorm in her office!

            The SCD team is a BIG FAN of Halloween, so we knew we wanted our first large event to be Halloween-related. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We ended up hosting this event at the CU Community Fab Lab and also partnered with Design For America, Industrial Designers Society of America, the Mannie L. Jackson Illinois Academic Enrichment and Leadership Program, and Illini Student Musicals. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            We wanted this event to be as collaborative as possible, so we tried to include as many different groups as possible in the planning process. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            There was costume making, pumpkin decorating, a terrifying Haunted Basement, and fun had by all!

            In October, SCD got to be a part of a really cool experience with the College of Veterinary Medicine and the company VetMed2.0.
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            This “Cat Hackathon” that Vet Med hosted focused on finding solutions for cats that do their business outside of their litter boxes, an issue which leads to many cats being relinquished to shelters. SCD hosted Pop-Up Workshop sessions where students were able to conduct design research with cat owners. 
            </p>
            <p className="serif">
            The insights gained from these sessions were then presented at the Hackathon for participants to use.

            It was a cat-tastic time!

                Our first interaction with our campus took place on Quad Day!!
                </p>
                <p className="serif">
                We wanted to do something different to really grab students’ attention, so instead of a typical Quad Day booth we decided to ditch the standard folding table and opt for a hot pink couch in its place.
                </p>
                <p className="serif">
                We also started our Slash Student conversation by asking students to tell us what their majors and side-gigs were. Oh, and we had a (root beer) keg. 
                </p>
                <p className="serif">
                This first interactive experience with students allowed us to start explaining the process of design thinking and what SCD is all about. It was a blast!
