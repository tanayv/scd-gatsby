In partnership with Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES), students use the design thinking process to develop potential solutions to accessibility issues, focusing on design refinement through rapid prototyping and building 3D printed models.

      "paragraphs": <><p className="serif">EDUC 201 is a course required for all Education majors and is for students who are interested in reflecting on their own experiences as learners. Students complete at least 20 hours of service at a non-profit community placement along with a lecture and discussion. The SCD team created a human-centered design workbook for students to complete and reflect on throughout the semester while they were in their community placements, giving them a structured approach around empathy exercises and need-finding for their target audience.

      "paragraphs": <><p className="serif">In ME 170, first year mechanical engineering students have their first opportunity to engage in the engineering design process. These students are tasked with developing a novel solution or product to address a problem that they identify. SCD has built into the class a human-centered design approach in which students interview people in their community to identify opportunity areas. They then propose a design based on these insights and develop a full computer aided design model to represent their ideas.</p></>,

The professor was interested in highlighting healthcare challenges both home and abroad, and worked with SCD to introduce a design thinking approach to the class, tasking students with conducting user interviews around the local healthcare system, which culminated in an all-class synthesis session.

      "paragraphs": <><p className="serif">A key component of the SCD strategy is to help students develop their design thinking skills, so we created a straightforward class to teach the principles of human-centered design. Students learn the process through project-based assignments that allow them to build skills in storytelling, synthesis, research methods, brainstorming, concept development, prototyping, and presenting. Students in this course immerse themselves in design thinking methods that encourage their creativity and improve their ability to make insights into user needs.
