Digital Making is in partnership with SCD and Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES), and specifically covers rapid prototyping and building 3D printed models.

      <p className="serif">
      Students work on interdisciplinary teams and use the design thinking process to develop potential solutions to accessibility issues. Near the end of the Spring 2019 semester, students in this course will participate in a Make-a-thon focused on accessibility. Students will create products inspired by those that are differently abled and the challenges that they face.

      Throughout the semester, students are expected to complete at least 20 hours of service at a community placement, along with a lecture and discussion. The SCD team created a human-centered design workbook for students to complete and reflect on throughout the semester while they were in their community placements, which they then used the following semester to build their empathy capacity.

These students are tasked with developing a novel solution or product to address a problem that they identify. They propose a design and develop a full computer aided design model to represent their ideas.

      Through collaboration with the Siebel Center for Design, the class project has taken a human-centered design approach in which students interview people in their community in order to identify opportunity areas. Their designs take on new value by addressing real and present challenges.

      This Spring 2019, SCD piloted a modular integration model, where SCD team members stepped in for a few specific touchpoints throughout the semester, introducing the concept of interviewing, tasking the students with going out and conducting their own, and culminating in an all-class synthesis session.
